        <p>
          Fujimoto was born on October 10, 1992, or 1993,[a] in Nikaho, Akita
          Prefecture, Japan.[5] He started drawing at an early age. He had no
          preparatory schools available near his home, so he went to painting
          classes in which his grandparents attended and practiced oil
          painting.[8] He graduated in Western painting from Tohoku University
          of Art and Design in Yamagata, Yamagata Prefecture in 2014.
